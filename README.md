## Reflection
### "What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?"   
Start earlier than I did, and figure out away to get myself to continue working   

### Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?     
Having to plan ahead of potential errors.   
Would be much easier if working with more than one set of data.   
(Biggest other issue I had was weird expectations, like assuming data wouldn't be hard coded into the .js file)   

### What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?   
Figure more data, figure more javascript tomfoolery that would give errors (why is date() like that?), and better organized to make it easier to approach.   

### Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again:
WORK AHEAD SO YOU CAN PUT MORE TIME FOR BEING AHEAD OF THE CLASS
