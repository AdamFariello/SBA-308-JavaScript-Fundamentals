# For grading
Look at answers.js

# TODO
## Mandatory
- [X] Create way of calculating the averages while also highlight each submission entry
    - [ ] Implement solution for in and out of the loop
    - [ ] Figure out why assignment id 3 isn't suppose to count for user 125
    - [ ] Restrict the calculations to 4 significant points
    - [ ] Calculate points off for submitting late
- [ ] Check if a submission is past the due date
    - [ ] Create function of calculating points lost due to this

- [ ] Split up function to a specific task
    - [ ] Make it so assignment is just returned

## Bonus
- [ ] Clean up the average function implementation, very <u>sloppy</u>
- [ ] Make the fractions the proper format (kinda extension of 4 sigs)

## For me personally
- [ ] Figure out if there's a reliable way for the order of properties added to an object will be the same order at all run times
- [ ] In obsidian, cover this coding situation:
```js
//console.log(assignment.points_possible) //TODO: Cover in obsidian
//console.log(assignment[0].points_possible)
```
